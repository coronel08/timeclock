# Timeclock Sample

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


![](./public/timeclock.png)

A Timeclock form example written in React. This is the Frontend only. Form, Navbar and Coordinate components are stored in components folder. 


Uses the following libraries
* Bootstrap - for styling and creating components like NavBar
* Used Geolocated but switched to browser API to reduce extras - gives coordinates


This project would need a backend database written out, authentication, an admin panel, and to convert geolocation to an address.
